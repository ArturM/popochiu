# Popochiu v2.0.3  

Popochiu 2.0.3 is here with a small but meaningful set of improvements and new documentation

## Fixes

- [The player character can no longer follow itself, preventing a stack overflow issue](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/385) - Thanks to [@guga2112](https://github.com/guga2112).
- [No more errors due to missing character animations](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/381) - Thanks to [@cidneyhamilton](https://github.com/cidneyhamilton) for fixing this regression introduced in 2.0.2 with PR [#341](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/pull/341).
- The version number in the Main Dock is now correct (it wasn't updated in the last release due to a minor oversight).

## Improvements

- [The "Link to item" property in a prop's inspector is now a neat dropdown](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/245).
- [The Tags section in the Aseprite importer inspector block is now collapsible again](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/390) - Thanks once more to [@guga2112](https://github.com/guga2112).

## Documentation

We've restructured and reorganized the documentation, reducing the number of "TODO" sections and making it (hopefully) easier to navigate.

Additionally, our docs now feature a fully expanded **Contribution Guidelines** section, making Popochiu a more mature FOSS project—welcoming and easier to grasp for new contributors.

While the average user might not directly benefit from these contributions, they’re exactly the kind of improvements that help projects thrive in the long run. We hope time will prove us right!

## Final Notes

This is a safe update from 2.0.2, so we encourage everyone to upgrade their projects to the latest version.
