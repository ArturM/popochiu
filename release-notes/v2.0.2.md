# Popochiu v2.0.2  

Our second _dot release_ of Popochiu 2 is here! What a great way to end the year, isn't it? This version fixes numerous bugs, adds polish to the plugin, and introduces exciting new features and capabilities.  

One of the highlights—and something we're particularly proud of—is that **no errors will appear when adding the plugin to a project**, and it's no longer necessary to restart Godot to start using it. Yikes!!!  

## Fixes

- [Fixed an issue with loading saved games after a change related to storing the `walk_to_point` and `look_at_point` of characters](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/343).  
- [The "Gibberish Spoken Text" feature in `Project Settings > Popochiu > Dialogs` is now working](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/331).  
- [`R.get_prop()` is now functioning correctly in all scenarios](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/328).  
- [`PopochiuCharacter.walk_to_clicked()` has been improved to handle edge cases more reliably](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/335).  
- [Fixed issues with **DialogText** components aligning dialogue lines, especially when adding colors (thanks to @BenjaTK)](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/262).  
- [Actions in `PopochiuRoom._on_room_entered()` now execute before the room is drawn to the screen](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/348).  
- [@balloonpopper fixed a bug causing the inventory in the SimpleClick GUI to play its close animation twice when clicked quickly](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/350).  
- [@balloonpopper also resolved a double call to the function that closes the Save & Load popup when saving the game](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/pull/363).
- @balloonpopper removed some warnings in Popochiu classes, and @edmundito fixed various spelling errors.

## Improvements

- [When Popochiu is added to a project, no errors will appear in Godot's Output, and developers won't need to restart the engine to use the plugin](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/250).  
- [Thanks to @balloonpopper, character movement now checks their facing direction more effectively, improving animation selection](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/334).  
- [@balloonpopper also optimized how characters process their animations while moving](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/issues/340).  

## Final Notes

That's all! Everyone working with 2.0 is encouraged to update and enjoy a more polished and capable version of our beloved plugin.
