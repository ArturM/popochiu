## Important to read

This version does not introduce breaking changes, but updating will run a migration to set the `look-at point` for all clickables in every room (the position will be the same as the `walk-to point`, with a slight offset on both axis so the gizmos won't overlap).  
**As always please, backup/commit your code before upgrading!**

## Final notes

We decided to shift Popochiu’s release cycle from a milestone-based approach to a cadence-based model, so that fixes, new features, and updates are released as soon as they’re ready. We also want you to upgrade your projects in small, frequent increments rather than having to face large and painful changes.

To support this model, we ditched the good old milestones and opened a [GitHUb project](https://github.com/orgs/carenalgas/projects/1/), which board reflects the current status.  
Keep an eye on the `Backlog` and `Ready` columns to see what's coming next.

That's all. Everyone working with 2.0 is encouraged to update and enjoy a more polished and capable version of our beloved plugin!
