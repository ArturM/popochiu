# Popochiu v2.0.0

[wave]We've finally reached this point!!![/wave] After (more than) a year of hard work, and a lot of broken promises, Popochiu 2.0 is stable.

## Fixes

- [A crashing bug when characters with no audio files for their voice said something, and a bug in the **PopochiuDialogMenu** when trying to update it number of options.](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/60d72ae49afb14846baf8c066c98399163127d09).

## New features

- [Inventory items now fit the height of the InventoryBar or the slots of the Inventory Grid](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/675c317e6d46516e76350af79ddb9fa7c40549c7).
- [Add properties to InventoryBar and SettingsBar so one can define if they should hide when the GUI is blocked (this was previously part of the Project Settings > Popochiu > GUI section)](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/90d2f745143ad50e5d473619e30711493ce40ce4).
- [TransitionLayer now uses a Control node to block interactions when a transition is playing](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/90d2f745143ad50e5d473619e30711493ce40ce4).
- [PopochiuClickable clicks are ignored if a dialog is running](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/90d2f745143ad50e5d473619e30711493ce40ce4).
- ⭐ [We made a HUGE refactor of **E** (`popochiu.gd`). Functions related to the camera are now in the PopochiuMainCamera class, functions related to the rooms are now in **R** (`i_room.gd`), and the same for other things related to specific objects](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/0654f655aae9ca187179424db14db0ac33e4b340).
- ⭐ [Thanks to the seminal contribution of @drbbgh, now Popochiu has custom gizmos for different properties](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/e009c9db36241d0a84d73dc2bcfcf4bc0d86b5e3). [Including one for the position of dialogs in characters](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/53d956ce166bd15f996fe028b55b6d29a0b92fb9). New gizmos will come in future versions to improve UX while working in the Editor.
- [We also refactored the class that renders Popochiu objects as rows in the Popochiu dock (PopochiuObjectRow) making the dock easier to improve, fix, and mantain](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/17a219e61cdf92207b6c22e21108240cbbfc7272).
- Started as a feature proposed (and initially coded) by @anthonyirwin82, [now we have a migration tool!!!](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/d45d95438f0a8059d9e7f6fbbee0052376c85c52) that will help devs who started their projects in alpha and beta versions to update to the release version. In future releases this tool will help us make sure (almost) everyone will be able to use the last stable version of the plugin without losing their work or being stuck with an old version.
- [You can use the `_on_move_ended()` in **PopochiuCharacter**s function to handle logic when it ends its movement](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/e93103b4d9424de6a412d22c6734edf837ee7965).
- [Defining the camera limits for rooms is easier now thanks to the new `width` and `height` properties](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/c32b78eb38413f630d8ff37a524d384f1a1a1674).
- [Thanks to @mefjak you can now enable gibberish text options in Project Settings > Popochiu > Dialogs](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/6cfd50f73dd944e96ac615a0156a404446aacea2). This is useful if you want to share screens or clips of your game without giving away important clues or dialog parts that may ruin the players' experience.
- [All the GUIs look more coherent now, and we made sure they share the same scene and components structure to make them easier to understand](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/b0a4fc49ddd605404f83e5f202325a0ed14b8edd). We also restructured and decoupled all the components to make them easier to upgrade in future releases.
- [The **TransitionLayer** was updated to improve how it adapts to the game native resolution and the new retro-pixel default one: 356x200](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/386f1021732309591879fdf9b3db85fa1e5e12ed).

## Other

- [You can post Proposals when creating an issue for the project](https://github.com/carenalgas/popochiu/commit/d4b12761af0e38923e024e43c63e2982de119974).
- We documented how to use our GUI templates.


## [:exclamation:] Important to read [:exclamation:]

If you already have a working project in Popochiu 2 - Beta X, you'll need to do a couple of things once the migration tool finishes its job:

1. The Setup popup should... pop-up for you to select a GUI (now we have only three options (we removed the Custom meanwhile)).
2. Select the GUI you want for your game, then click OK. The GUI will be copied, again, to the `res://game/gui/` folder (we made some changes and that's the reason why you'll need to do this).
3. Now the game's GUI will be on that folder, and you should delete the old `res://game/graphic_interface/` folder. If you made custom components or changes to the code, you'll have to copy them to the new `res://game/gui` folder manually. Take into account that your code should probably go in the scripts that end with `_custom.gd`.
4. That's all.
